## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox & Grid
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a nice way to practice analyzing a design, then programatically building the HTML structure, layout, accesibility, responsiveness, design, and functionality.  In a short time, I was able to accurately deliver the design requirements and add animation to the mobile menu with CSS and JS.
